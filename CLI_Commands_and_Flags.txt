grep : get -vE

-v (invert) : reverse the output

-E (Extended Regular Expressions) : Allows the use of |, + and others without using \ as escape character


Regex:
'^\s*($|#)' : a regex (Regular Expression), this is what we are looking for 
	^ : Matches the start of the line. Ensures the rest of the pattern is applied from the beginning of each line.
	\s* : 	\s → matches any whitespace character (space, tab, etc.)
		* → means zero or more occurrences of the preceding element
		So \s* matches any amount of leading whitespace, including none.
		This is important because a line might start with spaces or tabs before a comment
	($|#) : | → logical OR (alternation) 
		$ → end of line
		# → hash symbol, start of a comment
		So ($|#) matches either: The line is empty (end of line immediately after optional whitespace) or the line has a comment starting with #
Note: If the -E is not used, characters like (,| and ) will need \ to act as escape, so the regex will look like '^\s*\($\|#\)'

| (pipe) : push the output of the command on the left into the command on the right

wc (word count) :Can count lines, words, and bytes depending on the options given (-l lines, -w	words, -c bytes and -m characters)
	wc -l (lines)
	wc -w (words)
	wc -c (bytes)
	wc -m (characters)
