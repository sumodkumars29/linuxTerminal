Uninstalling Mantra

2. Identify the Device
To ensure you’re targeting the correct device, list all devices using the following command:
	pnputil /enum-devices
Note the Device Instance ID or Published Name.



3. Uninstall the Device Driver
Once you've identified the driver, uninstall it using the pnputil command:
	pnputil /delete-driver <Published Name> /uninstall /force

For example:
	pnputil /delete-driver oem12.inf /uninstall /force
Replace oem12.inf with the actual Published Name for the Mantra MF100 driver.



4. Remove Device from Device Manager
Identify the Device Instance ID:
	devcon find *
Find the entry for the fingerprint scanner and note its Device Instance ID.

Remove the device:
	devcon remove <Device Instance ID>

For example:
	devcon remove USB\VID_XXXX&PID_XXXX



5. Delete Residual Files
To clean up leftover files and folders:

Locate the installation directory for the Mantra MF100 drivers and software (commonly under C:\Program Files or C:\Program Files (x86)).
Delete the folder:
	rmdir /s /q "C:\Program Files (x86)\Mantra"


6. Clean Up Registry Entries (Optional)
Open the Registry Editor:
	regedit

Navigate to:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\USB
Search for entries related to "Mantra" or "MF100" and carefully delete them (only if you're confident).

7. Restart Your PC
After performing these steps, restart your computer to ensure all changes take effect.

pnputil and devcon are powerful tools. Be cautious while using them to avoid uninstalling or removing unintended devices.
If you don’t have devcon, download it from the Microsoft website or use PowerShell commands instead.
