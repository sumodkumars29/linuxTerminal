2. Boot into Windows 10
Restart your PC and boot into Windows.
Ensure you have administrative privileges in Windows to modify partitions.

3. Remove Garuda Linux Partitions
Open Disk Management:

Press Win + R, type diskmgmt.msc, and hit Enter.
Locate the partitions used by Garuda Linux. These will likely be:
EFI/boot partition (if using UEFI; shared with Windows but don't delete this if you're dual-booting).
Root partition (commonly formatted as ext4 or btrfs).
Swap partition (if created during installation).

Delete Linux Partitions:

Right-click on each Linux partition and select Delete Volume. These will turn into unallocated space.

Extend Windows Partition:

Right-click on your Windows partition (e.g., C:) and choose Extend Volume to merge the unallocated space into it.

4. Repair the Bootloader
Garuda Linux will have installed its bootloader (GRUB). 
To restore the Windows bootloader:

Create a Windows Recovery Drive (if you don’t have one):
Use another Windows PC to create a recovery USB using the Windows Media Creation Tool.

Boot from the Recovery Drive:
Insert the USB, restart your PC, and boot into the recovery environment.

Access Command Prompt:
In the recovery environment, choose Troubleshoot > Advanced Options > Command Prompt.

Run Bootloader Repair Commands:

Enter the following commands:
bash
Copy code
bootrec /fixmbr
bootrec /fixboot
bootrec /scanos
bootrec /rebuildbcd
Restart your PC to confirm that the Windows bootloader is restored.


Memory updated
To uninstall Garuda Linux and reclaim the space for Windows, follow these steps carefully:

1. Back Up Your Data
Before proceeding, back up any important files from both Windows and Garuda Linux to an external drive or cloud storage.
