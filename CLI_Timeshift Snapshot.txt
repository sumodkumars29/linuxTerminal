sudo pacman -S timeshift
:: Installing the timeshift app

sudo timeshift-gtk
:: opening the timeshift gui

sudo timeshift
:: running timeshift in the terminal

sudo timeshift --create
:: create a snapshot from the terminal

sudo timeshift --create --comments "Comment to be written"
:: create a snapshot and add a comment. Let's you know why and when the snapshot was created

sudo timeshift --list
:: List all created snapshots	


********************************************************************************
:: how you’d handle a restore from CLI (like when booting from a live USB).

- Boot into live USB
:: Use an Arch ISO (or any Linux live USB).

:: Mount your root partition :: For you it’s /dev/sda3
sudo mount /dev/sda3 /mnt

:: Bind mount system dirs (so Timeshift can see them):
for dir in /dev /proc /sys /run; do
  sudo mount --bind $dir /mnt$dir
done
Needs to be written as for dir in /dev /proc /sys /run; do sudo mount --bind $dir /mnt$dir; done
The 'for loop' above is equal to :
		sudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev
		sudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc
		sudo mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys
		sudo mount --bind /run /mnt/run

:: Chroot into your system
sudo chroot /mnt

:: Run Timeshift restore
sudo timeshift --restore

:: It will list your snapshots, ask you to pick one, and confirm overwrite.
::     Use arrow keys to select.
::     Confirm with y when it asks.

:: Exit the chroot
exit

:: how to unmount them all in one go after you’re done restoring
for dir in /dev /proc /sys /run; do sudo umount /mnt$dir; done

:: Then unmount your root partition
sudo umount /mnt

:: a quick check command to make sure nothing is still mounted before rebooting
mount | grep /mnt
findmnt /mnt


sudo reboot
